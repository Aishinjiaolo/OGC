OGC
Initial of /Original Geometry Computation/

For segment based geometry learning,
it will keep updating.


Currently containing:

source code: (./src/)
'point'   => point.cpp   point.h
'segment' => segment.cpp segment.h
'polygon' => polygon.cpp polygon.h
'api'     => api.cpp     api.h

usage demo: (./)
usage flow => main.cpp
auto make  => Makefile


To make all:
  ./make

To make library only:
  ./make lib

To run:
  ./run

To clean:
  ./make clean


Unit test is run under google test framework.

1. Please go to: http://code.google.com/p/googletest/
   and download the latest version of gtest.
   (currently, I am using version 1.6.0)
2. Put gtest wherever you like.
3. Edit Makefile, and modify 'TEST_DIR' to your gtest dir.
4. Put every unit test file(*.cc) in ./test/

To make unit test:
  ./make gtest

To run unit test:
  ./unittest

To clean unit test:
  ./make tclean

Some unit test's been put in ./test/ for your reference.


Python bundle flow is supportted by SWIG wrapping

1. Please go to: http://www.swig.org/
   and download the latest version of SWIG.
   (currently, I am using version 2.0.4)
2. You may modify the run.py in current directory which is
   supposed to import bundled capi library.
3. You may write out GDSII files to validate your geometry
   in this python flow.
4. GDSII module is from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdspy/

To make and run python flow:
  ./make pyflow

To clean python flow:
  ./make pyclean

A sample GDSII file: sample.gds will be generated in current directory.
